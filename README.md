_Javascript Tutorials for the Developer Portal_

These examples/tutorials will familiarize you with the basics of operating on the steem blockchain.

Each tutorial is located in its own folder, and has a README.md with an outline of the basic concepts
and operations it intends to teach. Some of the tutorials use the production blockchain, others use a [testnet](#Production-Blockchain-vs.-Testnet).

The tutorials build on each other. It's suggested you go through them in-order.

1.  clone this repo

    `git clone git@github.com:steemit/devportal-tutorials-js.git`

1.  cd into the tutorial you wish to run

    ex: `cd tutorials/01_blog_feed`

1.  Use npm or yarn to install dependencies

    ex: `npm i`

1.  Run the tutorial

## Production Blockchain vs. Testnet

These tutorials favor use of the production Steem blockchain. However, some produce content that would be spammy. And
spam on a blockchain, like everything else on a blockchain, is forever. Eww.

So for those tutorials we use a [testnet](https://testnet.steem.vc/) setup and maintained by user
[@almost-digital](https://steemit.com/@almost-digital). You can see its current status, and learn how to easily create
accounts and connect to it at [https://testnet.steem.vc/](https://testnet.steem.vc/). And depending on the day, you can
even use an outdated version of [condenser](https://github.com/steemit/condenser) to crawl it at
[https://condenser.steem.vc/](https://condenser.steem.vc/)

Credentials for demo accounts on the testnet are in [tutorials/configuration.js](tutorials/configuration.js)`.
Because this information is public, someone may have changed the keys of these accounts. If this has happened,
you can either wait until the testnet reboots, or create an account or two of your own.
